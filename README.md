# Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Lunar Lander
This project implements a deep reinforcement learning agent using the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to train an agent to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon's surface by optimizing its actions over a series of episodes.

## Environment
The Lunar Lander environment simulates the task of landing a spacecraft safely on the moon's surface. The agent controls the spacecraft's thrusters to adjust its position and velocity, aiming to land smoothly on a designated landing pad.
- Environment Documentation: [Lunar Lander Environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/)
- OpenAI Gym Installation: `pip install gym`

## Agent
The agent is implemented using deep reinforcement learning techniques, specifically using deep Q-learning (DQN) or another suitable algorithm. The agent learns from experience by interacting with the environment and updating its policy to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

## Usage
To run the deep reinforcement learning agent:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the training script
This script trains the agent on the Lunar Lander environment for a specified number of episodes (default: 1000).
5. Plot the learning progress:
After training, the script generates two figures to visualize the learning progress:
- Figure 1: Rewards vs Episodes
- Figure 2: Training Loss vs Episodes

## Results
The learning progress of the agent can be visualized through plots showing rewards and training loss over episodes. Additionally, videos or gifs can be used to demonstrate how the trained agent performs in the Lunar Lander environment.
